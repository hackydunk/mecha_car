MPG Regression

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Both vehicle.weight and spoiler.angle proivded non-random amounts of variance because the Pr(>|t|) values were greated than 0.05.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 2.277e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05.
Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
It effectively predicts MPG because our "Multiple R-squared" value is .7149 which means we are correct ~71% of the time.
We must also be cautious of "overfitting".

Suspension Coil Summary

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.
Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?

Mean - 1498.78
Median - 1500
std.dev - 7.89
var - 62.29

The variance of the suspension coils is within specification according to the summary table. The spec call for 100
and the var is 62.29 which is well within spec.

Suspension Coil T-Test


	One Sample t-test

data:  suspension$PSI
t = -1.8931, df = 149, p-value = 0.06028
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500
95 percent confidence interval:
 1497.507 1500.053
sample estimates:
mean of x 
  1498.78 

Assuming our significance level was the common 0.05 percent, our p-value is above our significance level.
Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.

Design Your Own Study

We can take a random sample of similar size cars of other brands and perfom a
Two-Sample-t-Test to study MPG efficiency differences between the Mechacar and other brands.

Is the MechaCar MPG efficiency statistically signficantly different from other brands?

Our null and alternative hypothesis are as follows...

H0 : There is no statistical difference between the two observed sample means.
Ha : There is a statistical difference between the two observed sample means.

The data that needs to be collected are the MPG data for both the Mecha Car as well as the brands of interest.
A population mean must also be calculated which can be from a dataset of multiple brands of cars.
